    description: "The Polestar 3 is the brand's first purpose-built SUV, representing a significant expansion of the Polestar lineup beyond the performance-oriented Polestar 1 and the fastback Polestar 2. Built on Volvo's SPA2 (Scalable Product Architecture) platform, it features distinctive aerodynamic styling with a sloping roofline, muscular proportions, and Polestar's minimalist design language. The exterior incorporates unique elements including a 'SmartZone' front panel housing various sensors, aerodynamic optimization through the front aero wing integrated into the hood, rear aero wings, and distinctive split headlights with Polestar's signature 'Thor's Hammer' daytime running lights. Initially available exclusively with a dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain producing 489 horsepower and 620 lb-ft of torque in standard form, with an optional Performance Pack increasing output to 517 horsepower and 671 lb-ft. Power comes from a 111 kWh battery pack (107 kWh usable) providing approximately 300 miles of EPA-rated range, with 250 kW DC fast-charging capability allowing a 10-80% charge in approximately 30 minutes. The spacious five-seat interior features sustainable materials including bio-attributed MicroTech upholstery, recycled polyester, and FSC-certified wood. Technology is centered around a 14.5-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen running Android Automotive OS, complemented by a 9-inch driver display and an available 25-speaker Bowers & Wilkins audio system. Advanced driver assistance is provided through a comprehensive suite of radar, camera, and ultrasonic sensors, plus a standard LIDAR system from Luminar that enables enhanced future autonomous capabilities. The Polestar 3 positions itself as a performance-oriented, technology-forward electric SUV competing with premium offerings from established luxury brands and other electric vehicle specialists, with manufacturing taking place both in China and the United States."
